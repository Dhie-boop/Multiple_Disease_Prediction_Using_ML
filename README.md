# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_Using_ML

Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction System repository! This application, powered by machine learning algorithms and built using Streamlit, enables users to predict the likelihood of three common diseases: heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.

Features:
1. Predictive Models:
The system is equipped with trained machine learning models for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes prediction.

3. Input Data:
Users can input relevant medical data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., depending on the disease being predicted.

5. Prediction Results:
Based on the provided input, the system generates predictions regarding the likelihood of the user having each of the three diseases.

Make sure you have Python installed in your machine
